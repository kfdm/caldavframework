# TODO

It is inevitable that developers try to build their own ToDo app. This is my attempt

## Goals

* Well thought out keyboard shortcuts. See THL for examples
* Sync with external systems. Be able to link to a JIRA or Github issue but track it within this app
* Support for start date in addition to end date
* Support for recurring tasks
